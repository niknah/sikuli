### VNCRobot version

Connects up to a VNC server instead of tying up the mouse/keyboard.

* Example... (replace 192.168.1.111 with the ip address of the vncserver)

```python
vncscreenid=JScreen.connectVNC(["vncviewer","192.168.1.111"],"password")
vncscreen=Screen(vncscreenid)

# Then everything will have to be accessed via the new "vncscreen" object.

vncscreen.click(Location(1,1))
vncscreen.type("abc")
vncscreen.find("xxx.png")
```

* You can add vncviewer options to the connection....

```python
vncscreenid=JScreen.connectVNC(["vncviewer","-encodings","tight","-quality","5","192.168.1.111"],"password")
```

What is Sikuli?
===============

Sikuli is a visual technology to automate graphical user interfaces (GUI)
using images (screenshots). The current release of Sikuli includes Sikuli
Script, a visual scripting API for Jython, and Sikuli IDE, an integrated
development environment for writing visual scripts with screenshots easily.
Sikuli Script automates anything you see on the screen without
internal API's support. You can programmatically control a web page, a
desktop application running on Windows/Linux/Mac OS X, or even an
iphone application running in an emulator.

More detail information can be found on http://sikuli.org
